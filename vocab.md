shows the relation between several sets in a clear way
## subset

## union
{{1}}
The union of two sets contains every element of the two sets 
(without containing the same element twice!)

{{3}}
analogous to the logical "or"

## intersection
{{1}}
The intersection of two sets contains every element that is both in A and B

{{3}}
analogous to the logical "and"

## cartesian product
{{1}}
The cartesian product is the set of all combinations of the elements from A with the elements from B in the form of ordered pairs

## universial set
{{1}}
The universal set is the set that contains every element. When examining sets you always look at them within a specific universal set

The complement of A is the set that contains every element except the ones that are in A

# Electronic parts
The source for each part is wikipedia, with some school knowledge on top.

> by Theodor and Vincent
## 1. Electric motor
"Elektromotor"

Electric part that converts electrical into mechanical energy.
Used in a wide area, for example electric cars, hobby projects (i.e. RC Cars, ...)
![${electric motor}](https://www.omemotors.de/media/wysiwyg/statics/smoke-mobile.png)

## 2. Transistor
Semiconductor, that is used to switch and/or amplify electric signals

It is used in all modern electronic devices.

## 3. LED
LED stands for "light-emitting diode" and converts electrical energy into light.

## 4. Capacitor
"Kondensator"

A capacitor stores electrical energy in an electric field, and can release it when it is fully charged.

In contrast to batteries, it can only store a small amount of energy, but can release it much faster.

## 5. Resistor
"Widerstand"

Resistors resist the flow of electricity, and can therefore be used to reduce current flow or divide voltages.
![${resistor}](https://content.instructables.com/F00/72CL/IRXT3HTJ/F0072CLIRXT3HTJ.jpg)
## 6. Potentiometer
A potentiometer is essentially a variable resistor, through which the resistance can be adjusted, instead of being fixed like it is with a resistor
![${potentiometer}](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Electronic-Component-Potentiometer.jpg)
## 7. Switch
"Schalter"

A switch is used to close or open a path for the electricity to flow through.
Typical examples include things like light switches or switches on household devices.
![${switch}](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AbqGWNIItTo/maxresdefault.jpg)
## 8. Relay
"Relais"

A relay is basically a switch. However, it is operated eletrically, meaning you dont need to touch it to open/close the circuit.

This works by having two circuits in this part. One is the primary circuit which usually runs high voltage, and the other runs low voltage that closes and opens the path for the primary circuit through a coil.

## 9. Wire
"Kabel"

A wire is used to transmit electrical energy.

# Data evaluation

## Words (or the not so serious definition of some related buzz words)

### deposit
> storage location for arbitrary data, such as a disk or remote computer (aka. "the Cloud")

### trend
> term for an expectation about future results used in statistics

### discovery
> finding out about something

### implementation
> the way something was build from a reference concept

### strategy
> a procedure to approach a specific problem

### efficiency
> effort to result ratio

### mining
> searching for special entities in a large pool of data

### entity
> an unit or object with specific attributes and traits

### pool
> collection

### yield
> result after work, often related to efficiency

### delivery model
> idea about the way specific information is aquired

### cloud-based storage
> renting another persons harddrive

### remote assets
> data stored using a cloud-based storage solution

### asset
> literally any entity considered valuable

### resources
> anything can be a resource if it contains data

### data set
> somehow sorted or crossrelated data

### benchmark
> evaluation and comparison of work to time relationships

### appropriate
> something correct, eg. a specific tool

### analytics
> fancy maths that may or may not give correct or desired results.
> Nobody understands that anyway. Not event the person who invented it.

### outcome
> similar to yield, but it may not be what you wanted

### protocol
> either the list of performed steps or the list of steps that have to be executed in order

### statistical evidence
> numbers don't lie! (at least if you trust them)
