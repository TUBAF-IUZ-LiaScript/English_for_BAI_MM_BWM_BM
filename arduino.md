## Questions
### What it does and how it works
Our program is divided into three Parts:

{{1}}
The first part is an alternating pattern of red and a blue lights. This is for the Melbourne Demons, an Australian fotty club who's colours are red and blue.

{{1}}
```cpp Code part 1
for (int i = 0; i<NUM_LEDS; i++){
		if ((i)%2) {
			leds[i] = CRGB::Blue;
		}else{
		leds[i] = CRGB::Red;	
		}
	}
	FastLED.show();
	delay(2021);
	
	for (int j = 0; j < NUM_LEDS; j++)
        { 
         leds[j] = CRGB::Black;

        }
             FastLED.show();
```

{{2}}
The second part is showing the first 50 digits of pi, because why not? Pi is wonderful! These are each shown an obvious length of 3142 ms for 1000ms pi.

{{2}}
```cpp Code part 2
for (int j = 0; j < NUM_LEDS; j++)
        { 
         leds[j] = CRGB::Black;

        }
             FastLED.show();
	
	
	for (int i = 0; i<50; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j<numbers[i]; j++) {
			leds[j] = CRGB::Green;
 
		}
					            FastLED.show();
		delay(3142);
		for (int j = 0; j < NUM_LEDS; j++)
        { 
         leds[j] = CRGB::Black;

        }
             FastLED.show();
	}
```


{{3}}
The last part is just quick flashing lights, so we could win the award for bringing the most medical harm.

{{3}}
```cpp Code part 3
for (int i = 0; i<500; i++){
	    for (int i = 0; i<NUM_LEDS; i++){
	    	leds[i] = CRGB::White;
	}
	FastLED.show();
	delay(100);

	for (int i = 0; i<NUM_LEDS; i++){
		leds[i] = CRGB::Black;
	}
	FastLED.show();
	delay(100);}
```

### Where the idea came from?

The idea came from Theodor who brought together two of his interests, with the urgent need to create an award winning masterpiece. We aimed for nothing less then all 6 possible awards and less then 4 is most definitely a failure. Even tho the program is still nothing less then brilliant.

### Problems

Due to perfect groupwork, paired with excellent communication, we unexpectedly didn't encounter any problems whatsoever.

### How we wrote the program

With tremendous effort, we overcame incredible difficulties copy and pasting the tutorial code and adapting it to fit our needs.
In a wonderfull dynamic hard work, we were able to implement all of the first fifty digits of pi in our wonderful and highly efficient dataformat, also known as as signed integer array.

### Possible adjustments
Obviously it is tremendously had to find adjustments to such a great working program, unsurprinsingly we couldnt think of improvements in any possible case with our limited ressource in that project.
Alternatively we could think of slight adjustments, for example instead of pi you could use other irrational numbers, i.e. square root 2 or napier constant 'e'. otherwise you could as well use different colours in the beginning to your choosing (maybe your favourite sport team and have some guess the team ;)). Try your luck and if you get very creative and make it marketable, maybe remember our wonderful idea and give us a small piece of your big pie :D. 
Good night lights out.

## Documentation of the Rainbow

Rainbow light implementation on an Arduino is a fun and creative project that produces a mesmerizing rainbow color display using an Arduino microcontroller. The implementation involves a sequence of RGB LED lights that change colors in a smooth and continuous pattern.

The idea for this project came from the desire to create a colorful and visually appealing display that could be used for various applications, such as mood lighting, party decorations, or simply for fun. The concept of using RGB LED lights to create a rainbow effect was inspired by the phenomenon of natural rainbows, which display a similar sequence of colors.

The rainbow light implementation on an Arduino works by controlling the amount of red, green, and blue light emitted by each LED to create the desired color. By varying the intensity of each color, the Arduino can produce a transition of colors from red to orange, yellow, green, aqua, blue, and purple, creating a beautiful rainbow effect.

However there were problems to be faced. It took us one semester to study coding on an Arduino. Some of us even got left behind due to burnout. After that we had to learn new methods to connect to the Arduino and upload the code, which resulted in time consuming challenges.

One possible addition to this project could be to add a sound sensor that detects the beat of music and synchronizes the color display with the rhythm. This would enhance the project's entertainment value and make it a great addition to any party or event.

### long version
However, the journey of implementing the rainbow light on an Arduino was not without its challenges. It took us an entire semester to study and grasp the coding principles required to program the Arduino effectively. Some of us faced burnout along the way, struggling to keep up with the demanding learning curve.

After gaining a solid understanding of Arduino programming, we faced another hurdle â€“ learning new methods to connect to the Arduino and upload the code. This process proved to be time-consuming and presented us with unexpected challenges. It required us to familiarize ourselves with the intricacies of hardware connections, ensuring the components were properly wired and functioning correctly.

Despite the difficulties we encountered, our determination and passion for the project kept us going. We sought assistance from experienced Arduino enthusiasts, delved into online resources, and actively collaborated with one another to troubleshoot issues and find solutions.

With persistence and perseverance, we gradually overcame these obstacles. Our hard work paid off when we successfully uploaded the code to the Arduino and witnessed the mesmerizing display of rainbow colors illuminating the room. The sense of accomplishment we felt was indescribable.

This project taught us the value of patience, dedication, and teamwork. It reinforced the importance of taking breaks and avoiding burnout during the learning process. We also gained valuable knowledge and skills that will undoubtedly benefit us in future endeavors.

In the end, despite the challenges we faced, the beautiful and captivating rainbow light implementation on the Arduino made every hurdle worthwhile. It serves as a testament to our determination, resilience, and the power of creative expression through technology.

### Usage

Even though morse code is not as popular for sending messages as it was 130 to 150 years ago, there are still some use cases for this - even though most will not be very practical.

For example, it can be used to learn morse code. You can find out what a message would look like in morse code or try to translate morse code back into the latin alphabet.

### History

The morse code is, although not the oldest, but one of the most simple ways to communicate. It works with only two indicators called â€žditsâ€œ and â€ždahsâ€œ. These are often visualized using the well known symbols `.` and `-`.

Samuel Morse invented the method to convert entire sentences and numbers into dits & dahs and back, explaining the name of morse code.

Originally morse code was used to communicate over long distances using telegraphs. Typically a button emits an impulse as long as it is pressed. By alternating the duration of those impulses, combinations of dits and dahs can be sent almost everywhere in a matter of milliseconds. If the signal is transmitted using a wire, the receiver just has to connect something that makes the impulses visible, for example a bulb or a speaker.

## Description

{{1}}
>**What does it do?**  
>
>Simulate a wave propagating from left to right. After 5 times a wave reaches the end the distance between each wave gets smaller until they overlap. After this the LEDs turn white and the program restarts.

{{2}}
>**How does it work?**  
>
>For each wave 3 LEDs are turned on and move one position forward by turning on the LED in front of the wave and turning off the last LED.

{{3}}
>**How we did it?**  
> 
>First creating a function which is used for moving a specific wave forward. After that for having multiple waves the position of each wave is saved in an array to loop over each wave to use the move function. To manage having diffrent amounts of visible waves at diffrent times a wave gets the value -1 to make sure it is not moving

{{4}}
>**What we could add?**  
>
>To make the ending with white lights less abrupt we could change the colors of the waves gradually to white, which means the colors would get brighter the closer the waves get. Of course the color at the end don't has be white. It could also approach a diffrent color. The end color could be changed after every run.
